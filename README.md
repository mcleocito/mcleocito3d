## Why am I working on this?
Mostly for fun, it's entertaining for me to develop this 3D engine.
## How can you try it?
I have published some tests made in JavaScript that you can try on your browser: [mcleocito.dev/#engine](https://mcleocito.dev/#engine)

I won't upload it to this repository yet because its code is so messy that I am ashamed of it.
## To-do list
- [x] All of what has been done until test 7
- [ ] Improve lighting
- [ ] Textures
- [ ] Improve rendering order
- [ ] Shadows?
