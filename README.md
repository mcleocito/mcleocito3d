# mcl3DEngine (Temporary name)
## Why am I working on this?
Mostly for fun, I find developing this 3D engine entertaining.
## Is there any way of trying it?
I have published some tests made in JavaScript that you can try on your browser: [mcleocito.dev/#engine](https://mcleocito.dev/#engine)

I won't upload the source code to this repository yet.
## To-do list
- [x] ECMAScript (JavaScript) version *(Achieved in [Test 1](https://mc41chat.web.app/3dengine_tests/3dengine/))*
- [x] C++ port
- [x] Getting the position of points in a 2D screen given the 3D position of the points and the position and rotation of the camera *(Achieved in [Test 3](https://mc41chat.web.app/3dengine_tests/3dengine_test3_wasd/))*
- [x] Very simple lighting *(Achieved in [Test 10](https://mc41chat.web.app/3dengine_tests/test10_clean/))*
- [ ] Improve lighting
- [x] Textures (Affine perspective) *(Achieved in [Test 12](https://mc41chat.web.app/3dengine_tests/test12_clean/))*
- [ ] Textures (Correct perspective)
- [x] Improve rendering order *(Achieved in [Test 12](https://mc41chat.web.app/3dengine_tests/test12_clean/))*
- [ ] Shadows
